            <h2>Shadertoy Rasterizer</h2>
            <p>
                A cube rendered in real time with shader code written on the website shadertoy.
                This project was created when I was studying real time graphics and the rendering
                pipeline. In order to better grasp the concepts involved when turning three dimensional
                vertex data into visible pixels on screen I decided to create a simplified version
                of the process using shadertoy. Projects on the website are written in glsl along with
                some additional functions provided by shadertoy. The cube was rendered by taking a set
                of verticies and transforming them into clip space, projecting these onto the screen,
                and rasterizing the triangles to form the cube.

            <p>
                For this project I had to research the different steps that goes into rendering
                something on screen more in depth. I read about and applied the math required to
                render 3D vertecies onto a 2D plane with perspective projection as well as how to
                detect when a pixel is inside a triangle. The set of vertecies had corresponding
                normals due to me wanting to implement a lighting model as well, however I did not
                have the time for it. The biggest challenge, which came right before the cube was
                finished, was an issue where it would not render properly because I was using the
                wrong function for triangle rasterization. It was difficult to tell if the problem
                was due to a fault in the projection, rasterization, or if I had simply misunderstood
                the pipeline, but after several more reviews of litterature and cross comparing with
                similar projects I managed to find out the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                After this project I felt more familiar with the real time graphics pipeline and I
                had also gotten some experience writing shader code using glsl. In the future I might
                go back and add lighting to further experiment with vertex normals.
