            <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                I was involved in the creation of four video game prototypes each made
                in two weeks time. Each game was made with a guiding prompt and some had
                additional challenges which inspired the development process. The prompts
                were:
                <li>Game & Watch</li>
                <li>Lying</li>
                <li>6 players or more</li>
                <li>A piece of music</li>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to practice fast prototyping from ideation to
                minimum viable product. We were a team of three who worked on all games, my 
                role consisted of programming and designing game features. Games were
                built using both Unity and Godot and all are available to play on Itch.io.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing these games in such short timeframes definitely improved my ability
                to quickly prototype ideas into playable products and decrease the time spent
                over-analyzing ideas in team discussions. Working closely in a small team with
                short deadlines also required good communication and mutual trust. In the end I
                am quite happy with the games we made, some of which show promise for further
                development!

                This game was made for the prompt "Game & Watch", In it you play as the
                green character who needs to collect parts and drop them off at the flag.
                A ghost chases you and if you are caught you lose a life. If you drop off
                all items without being hit, you win and proceed to the next level.

            <p>
                The prompt for this game was lying. The game is a clicker game where
                you earn money buy clicking a safe, and buy upgrades to increase your passive
                income. However, as soon as the income starts getting automated, you stop
                earning clean money and start earning dirty money which the shop doesn't accept.
                To clean your money, you have to dip each bill individually in a sink and hang
                them on a drying rack. With enough cleaned, you can buy a washing machine!

            <p>
                This game was created for the prompt 6 players or more. One player takes the
                role of the astronaut while the other players are floating stars. The astronaut
                must climb upwards with the help of the stars who can push boxes, block fireballs,
                and more. Levels were created for 2, 4, and 6 player modes.

            </p>
            <p>
                The final prompt was a piece of music. Inspired by the lyric "Check it out I'm in
                the house like carpet" in a joke video we made Like Carpet. A game where you play
                as a dog that can turn into objects and enter spaces. At any time you can press a
                button to have the dog read out it's current state, which is compared to a sentence
                on screen. If the state of the dog is identical to the sentence, the game progresses
                to a new sentence. Complete a couple of sentences to win!
