                In Climb Me to the Moon one player takes the role of an astronaut trying to climb to
                the moon. Helping them are floating stars who can push objects and block projectiles to
                help the astronaut advance.

                The game was originally made for a course about rapid prototyping with the prompts
                6 player or more multiplayer, and 2 bit color. Development started during a Valentine's 
                game jam which added the additional theme "To the moon and back". The jam took place over
                a weekend and, by the end, the first prototype of Climb Me to the Moon won the awards for
                most fun and best interpretation.

                The game was then further developed and displayed at
                Gotland Game Conference 2025 where it recieved the Jury Spotlight award, as well as
                nominations for the Public Choice, Best Level Design, and Best Art Direction awards.

                During its initial development, the biggest challenge was learning the Godot game engine
                and its scripting language GDScript while working to complete the game in the span of 48 hours.
                Luckily, in my team of three, one of us had previous experience with the engine and I could ask
                them if I got stuck or confused. During the development for the main course, we worked on the characters
                as well as the separate platformer components we would use to build levels. This made it easy to split up
                work. I created the projectile firing cannons, pair programmed with my teammate to fix issues with
                the camera and physics, took part in designing levels and tested controller communication with Godot.

                As we continued with the game to display it at Gotland Game Conference many things were polished. Much
                of my work focused on the astronaut character. I restructured the astronaut controlling script into an
                enum state machine to make it easier to work with. The improved stucture the character script
                allowed me to implement a falling and landing animation. I implemented jump buffering and coyote time to
                improve the platforming game feel. I also implemented the death animation of the astronaut and used
                Godot's built in event signals at the end of the animation to trigger the scene to reload.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked with level loading and persistent objects. This was done in Godot by having a persistent main
                scene tree which loaded a subtree containing a specific level screen in response to event signals. This
                made it possible to have a persistent audio source and game manager while being able to reset levels on
                death and resets. For the transition between level loads, I also implemented several curtain transition
                animations which played in response to event signals.
