            <h2>Atlantean Descent</h2>
            <p>
                A vertical slice project made in Unreal Engine 5. In Atlantean Descent you play
                as two divers on their journey to discover Atlantis. Gameplay consists of turn-based
                combat where you control the two characters fighting their way through AI controlled 
                mermaid monsters, with exploration elements. The game was worked on for 10 weeks,
                after which it was displayed at the Gotland Game Conference 2024.

                Behind this project was a team of 14 people, I was one of three programmers. Some of my
                contributions include implementing the enemy AI, A* algorithm for entity pathfinding,
                metasound callbacks for the adaptive music and general contributions to the combat
                system and hexagon grid. All of the game's code was written using Unreal Engine's
                Blueprint scripting language.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project taught me a lot about working with the Unreal Game Engine. It was the
                largest project I had been a part of and it gave me experience working with larger
                code bases, which meant larger and more complicated bugs as well. For the most
                complicated bugs, I found it really helped to collaborate with other programmers.
                Toghether we'd usually be able to step through the problem. When one was stuck,
                the other could ask questions to make sure that all options were exhausted. It really
                gave me a new perspective on teamwork in programming!
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we had such a large team, all kinds of communication were essential.
