            <h2>Tetris in C++</h2>

                As part of the course "C/C++ 4 - Games in 2D" one of the assignments
                instructed us to program a game using C++ and the raylib library. Some requirements
                included having more than 3 game states, a collision testing screen and a list of high
                scores that was saved to and read from a file. I decided to recreate Tetris on the Gameboy since it
                would require a different approach from the top down
                character centered games I was used to from previous projects.
                The scope also seemed reasonable in the context of the assignment.

                Throughout the project I would play Tetris to analyze how each gameplay element worked
                and attempt to capture the same feel as playing the original on the Gameboy. This challenged my
                ability to think in code by taking a familiar game experience and having to translate each element
                into coding logic. It helped familiarize me more with programming tile systems
                due to Tetris' grid based systems. I also utilized file reading and writing for the first time to
                save high score data. The most difficult and bug prone parts to get right
                were the rotation and collision testing of falling pieces. I went the extra mile to have
                each block rotate just like they do on the Gameboy, which meant shifting them to align correctly.
                An additional challenge was figuring out how the code as a whole should be structured since gameplay
                didn't revolve around a typical player character on screen like I was used to.
