                After a couple of months working with C++ and with one group project game under the 
               belt it was time to make one by myself. The assignment was to copy an existing game
               called "Shoot Rock", by Jakub Wasilewski available on itch.io. The game is a simple
               arcade style space shooter where you control a spaceship trying to survive waves of
               asteroids while collecting points gathered by shooting them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the challenges with this game was management of dynamic entities, asset management,
                code structuring and more. Since this was my first solo game project, many things were still
                new. To solve any issues I had, I made use of previous projects and examples from my
                education along with conducting my own research and applying problem solving where there
                were still question marks.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the project I felt I had gained a lot more confidence in my ability to code games using
                C++. It even motivated me to create an alternative version of the game where instead of
                shooting asteroids, you shoot other spaceships in a race to refill your depleting fuel tank
                with the goal of making it to the end without running out.
