            <h2>Pig Microgame</h2>
            <p>For the final group assignment of the course "Game Design 1 - Introduction" we
                were tasked to create a series of microgames in Unity that had a common link tying them
                all together. My group consisted of 6 people and each of us individually created
                one of the total 6 microgames. The story was about the life of a pig on a farm.
                My game was last chronologically and showed the pig being roasted after having
                left the farm with a false hope of finding happiness.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was my first time working with Unity. The purpose of the assignment was 
                to get us familiar with the engine while creating very simple games, which would
                prepare us for upcoming courses where Unity played a larger role. Before this I
                had only created games using C++ along with the raylib library, so moving over to
                Unity and C# took some getting used to. Although I did feel out of my depth in the
                beginning with Unity's daunting interface, I had a vision for the game I wanted
                to make which motivated me throughout the process. At the end of it all I
                obtained a basic knowlege on GameObjects, the Scene Hierarchy, scripting in C#,
                importing assets, as well as creating a build of the game and uploading it to
                Itch.io.
