             Hello! I'm Jacob, a video game developer and enthusiast from the windy island of
             Gotland, Sweden. Currently I'm studying for a bachelor's degree in Game
             Design with a minor in Programming at Uppsala University Campus Gotland.
             Check out my portfolio page to see the projects I have worked on!
          </p>
          <h3>Why Games?</h3>
          <p>
            I am an avid consumer of all kinds of games, and have been for as long as
            I can remember! What started with Nintendo and Sony home consoles has now evoled into a
            passion for the games medium as a whole, both in the AAA and Indie scenes. As such, I
            have explored many of its genres to fully grasp the medium's potential and learn its best
            practices. Games have the ability to move others and be culturally impactful as pieces of art,
            and my main motivator since childhood has always been "I wanna do that too!!".
